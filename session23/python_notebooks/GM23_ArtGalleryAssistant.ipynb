Constable was fascinated with the broken textures of the heath, and made a number of studies of it seen from close to. Some of these are quite highly finished, like this example. A glimpse of more distant landscape to the right acts as a counterbalance, while the tiny figures on the horizon help establish the scale. \n",

These figures, old and young, and their placement in the graveyard may have been a deliberate way to build a deeper meaning into the scene, about the passage of time and our mortality. Though it is small, this was an important work for Constable – we think it was the first painting he submitted himself for exhibition at the Royal Academy.\n",
